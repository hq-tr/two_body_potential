 - Added L⁺L⁻ to v1_sphere.jl
 - Added sphere_FQHE_L2 for ED of L⁺L⁻
 - sphere_FQHE and sphere_FQHE_L2 now use in-line argument parsing (only tested for sphere_FQHE_L2)

 - Ported the working folder to github
 - Wrote an optimized algorithm for calculating the variational energy (expectvalue.jl). However the result is wrong for m >= 3 pseudopotential V_3
 - The ED routine, sphere_FQHE.jl, is somewhat optimized. Have not tested for m >= 3.
