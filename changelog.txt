 - Added an option to save eigenstates in expectvalue_ED.jl. Can be turned off by the --no-eigenstate flag to save disk space.

======= 2025-04-14 =======
 - Fixed the bug in expectvalue for interaction containing multiple term
 - Created expectvalue_ED.jl that allows exact diagonalization of two-body potential within a Hilbert space spanned by a given basis
 - Modified all routines to take in in-line arguments instead of keyboard input
======= 2024-02-28 =======
 - Added L⁺L⁻ to v1_sphere.jl
 - Added sphere_FQHE_L2 for ED of L⁺L⁻
 - sphere_FQHE and sphere_FQHE_L2 now use in-line argument parsing (only tested for sphere_FQHE_L2)
======= 2024-01-13 ======= 
 - Ported the working folder to github
 - Wrote an optimized algorithm for calculating the variational energy (expectvalue.jl). However the result is wrong for m >= 3 pseudopotential V_3
 - The ED routine, sphere_FQHE.jl, is somewhat optimized. Have not tested for m >= 3.
